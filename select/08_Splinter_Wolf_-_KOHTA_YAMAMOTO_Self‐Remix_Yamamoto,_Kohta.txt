I'm so pretty I melt your facе off
Giving you trouble's become my obsеssion
Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

I'm gonna push you 'til your wheels come off
I'm gonna strike while you are chatting
Can burn them
Without them get alert
Just to me or else I'm gonna take it out
Be sorry that you ever had a doubt
Use me
Because if you lose me
I give them hell
They're gonna head on their steep

I'm so pretty I melt your face off
Giving you trouble's become my obsession
Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

I'm so pretty I melt your face off
Giving you trouble's become my obsession
Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

End of the day, I finally ruin their plans
I heard them say they wipe the floor with us
Never
We never surrender
Holding my breath
'Til I will make it through
It's in my blood
We'll do it just like you
Tortured
But we're getting slaughtered
I give them hell
They're gonna head on their steep

I'm so pretty I melt your facе off
Giving you trouble's become my obsеssion
Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

I'm so pretty I melt your facе off
Giving you trouble's become my obsеssion
Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

I'm so pretty I melt your facе off

Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in

'M so pretty I melt your facе off
Giving you trouble's become my obsеssion
Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

'M so pretty I melt your facе off
Giving you trouble's become my obsеssion
Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

Wake up for action

Wake up for action

Wake up, wake up, wake up for action

I'm so pretty I melt your facе off
