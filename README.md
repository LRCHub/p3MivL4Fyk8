[02:19.20] I'm gonna push you 'til your wheels come off
[02:22.83] I'm gonna strike while you are chatting
[02:25.43] Can burn them
[02:28.48] Without them get alert
[02:33.65] Just to me or else I'm gonna take it out
[02:37.34] Be sorry that you ever had a doubt
[02:40.50] Use me
[02:43.09] Because if you lose me
[02:54.09] 
[02:48.23] I give them hell
[02:49.88] They're gonna head on their steep
[03:06.38] 
[02:55.06] I'm so pretty I melt your face off
[02:58.42] Giving you trouble's become my obsession
[03:02.11] Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
[03:05.72] Wake up, wake up, wake up for action
[03:23.72] 
[03:09.60] I'm so pretty I melt your facе off
[03:13.07] Giving you trouble's become my obsеssion
[03:16.76] Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
[03:20.24] Wake up, wake up, wake up for action
[03:38.24] 
[03:39.11] End of the day, I finally ruin their plans
[03:42.76] I heard them say they wipe the floor with us
[03:45.91] Never
[03:48.49] We never surrender
[03:53.67] Holding my breath
[03:55.39] 'Til I will make it through
[03:57.25] It's in my blood
[03:58.99] We'll do it just like you
[04:00.43] Tortured
[04:03.05] But we're getting slaughtered
[04:17.55] 
[04:08.26] I give them hell
[04:09.81] They're gonna head on their steep
[04:26.31] 
[04:15.06] I'm so pretty I melt your face off
[04:18.46] Giving you trouble's become my obsession
[04:22.13] Swinging fast, I'm gonna break your heart and
[04:25.79] Wake up, wake up, wake up for action
[04:43.79] 
[04:29.64] I'm so pretty I melt your face off
[04:33.10] Giving you trouble's become my obsession
[04:36.83] Swinging fast, I'm gonna crack your heart in
[04:40.34] Wake up, wake up, wake up for action
